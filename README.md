Pebble Wiper for Tool Changing 3D Printers

Check out my Youtube video explaining the Pebble Wiper!

I created these files for my own personal use, but due to widespread interest have posted them here. 
At this time I am the only person to have used this system, and as such am only releasing the files as release candidates for future, more pollished releases once others have been able to inegrate it into their machines.

Included files were modeled in SolidWorks 2019 with a student license, so don't even think about selling them :)

This system uses a single printed part (Pebble_Wiper), a micro servo with dimensions of 22.8x12x31 mm (I use a Hextronik MG-14), 3/5ths of an M5 washer, a standard Brass Brad, and a silicone brush (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08DHJGVC7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

Files with the prefix TESTING are separate mechanism and mounting files so you can dial in the offsets to fit the mounting positions on your printer.

I recently added the files for a Pebble Wiper which should work on the E3D Tool Changer / Motion System.

I have included the macro I use to activate the wiper during use. I add the callout of this macro to my tool change gcode in my slicer. I use PrusaSlicer, and cannot speak to the efficacy using other slicers, or printers not running RRF3.
