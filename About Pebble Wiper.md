Pebble Wiper for Tool Changing 3D Printers

Check out my Youtube video explaining the Pebble Wiper!

I created these files for my own personal use, but due to widespread interest have posted them here. 

Included files were modeled in SolidWorks 2019 with a student license, so don't even think about selling them :)

This system uses a single printed part (Pebble_Wiper), a micro servo with dimensions of 22.8x12x31 mm (I use a KST DS215MG or a Hextronik MG-14), a strip of metallic tape, and a silicone brush

I have included the macro I use to activate the wiper during use. I add the callout of this macro to my tool change gcode in my slicer. I use PrusaSlicer, and cannot speak to the efficacy using other slicers, or printers not running RRF3.
